# FunBooksAndVideos

## Introduction

FunBooksAndVideos is an e-commerce shop where customers can view books and watch online videos. Users can have memberships for the book club, the video club or for both clubs (premium).

## Purchase Order

A purchase order can contain products or membership requests. A purchase order has an PO ID, a customer ID and total price. There is an item line in the purchase order per product purchased (product, membership type). One example of a purchase order is the following:

- Purchase Order: 3344656 Total: 48.50
- Customer: 4567890
- Item lines:
  - Video "Comprehensive First Aid Training"
  - Book "The Girl on the train"
  - Book Club Membership

## Business Rules

Several business rules are applied when a purchase order is processed. Some of the business rules are shown in this list:
- **BR1**. If the purchase order contains a membership, it has to be activated in the customer account immediately.
- **BR2**. If the purchase order contains a physical product a shipping slip has to be generated.

## Tasks
- Implement an Object Oriented model of the system
-  Design a flexible purchase order processor
-  Implement the above business rules
